## There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!

Who am I making this out to? For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Take me to your leader! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. __Why did you bring us here?__ *I was having the most wonderful dream.* Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

### Bender, you risked your life to save me!

Fatal. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.

1. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!
2. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!
3. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!

#### Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?

I'll get my kit! We're rescuing ya. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

* You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?
* Bite my shiny metal ass.
* Throw her in the brig.

No! The cat shelter's on to me. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!

This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Meh. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? And then the battle's not so bad?

Say it in Russian! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Is that a cooking show? I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.

Say it in Russian! Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Leela's gonna kill me. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Oh God, what have I done? I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Pansy. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.

I love you, buddy! Now what? Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!

Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! One hundred dollars. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?
