## Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?

No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! __Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.__ *I expect to be well paid.* I'm in it for the money.

### I find your lack of faith disturbing.

Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

1. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.
2. As you wish.
3. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!

#### I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

Ye-ha! I find your lack of faith disturbing. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!

* The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
* I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--
* I call it luck.

Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Ye-ha! The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?

Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- What!? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I find your lack of faith disturbing. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.

What!? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Red Five standing by. Don't underestimate the Force. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I find your lack of faith disturbing.

What!? I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?
