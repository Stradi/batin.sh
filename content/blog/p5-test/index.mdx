import * as sketch1 from "./sketch1.ts";
import * as sketch2 from "./sketch2.ts";

## Start
This post demonstrates importing p5 sketch from `p5-test` folder and displaying it.

Below is an example p5 sketch just drawing red circle in the center of canvas.
<p5Wrapper sketch={ sketch1 } header="This is the sketch" footnote="This is footnote" />

We also can embed multiple sketches like below:

<p5Wrapper sketch={ sketch2 } />
